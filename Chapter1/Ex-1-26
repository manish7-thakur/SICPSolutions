Let n be the exponent and T(n) be time of calculating 'base ^ n'

T(n) = { 1 if n = 0
     = { T(n/2) + T(n/2) + log(n)           // log(n) for combining the result, now its a tree recursion so the result to be combined are equivalent to the height og the tree

T(n) = 2T(n/2) + log(n)

a=2 , b = 2 , f(n) = log(n)

applying master theorem

n ^ log(a) to base b = n ^ log(2) to base 2  = n which is greater than f(n)

case 1 of master theorem

   T(n) = Q(n ^ log (a) to base b) = Q(n)
